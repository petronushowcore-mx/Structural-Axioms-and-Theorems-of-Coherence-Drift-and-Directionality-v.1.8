# PETRONUS / Cybernetics 2.5 — Working Papers (Date-Fixed Repository)

This repository is a public, timestamped record of PETRONUS™ / Cybernetics 2.5 research artifacts and preprints.
It exists primarily to **fix disclosure dates** (prior-art anchoring) and provide a stable, citable location for
documents while the broader publication pipeline is in flux.

## Current publication status (important)
At the moment we have **temporarily lost access to our Zenodo account**, so new releases are being mirrored here to
preserve a clear chronological record (Git commit timestamps + release tags). Once Zenodo access is restored, the same
materials may be re-uploaded there with DOIs, while keeping this repository as an immutable public trail.

## What is included
- PDF preprints and architectural papers
- Formal notes, definitions, invariants, axioms/lemmas/theorems (as papers, not as code)
- Supporting artifacts intended for citation and date anchoring

## What is NOT included (by design)
- Implementation internals, full operational thresholds, deployment parameters
- Any “how-to-build” details that would reduce the work to an implementation recipe
- Private evaluation infrastructure

This repository is meant to disclose **architectural framing and formal structure** while keeping implementation
details implementation-dependent.

## How to cite
Until Zenodo DOIs are available again, cite using:
- Repository URL (GitHub)
- Release tag (recommended) or commit hash
- File name + version (as written in the PDF)

Example citation pattern (adapt to your style):
> Barziankou, M. (MxBv). “Title of Work”, version X.Y, GitHub repository release TAG / commit HASH, YYYY-MM-DD.
